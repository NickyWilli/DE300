# HW1 Readme file

To run the code, first add the file "T_F41SCHEDULE_B43.csv" to the Jupyter environment and install
the required libraries (provided in the code). Run the rest of the code sequentially. 


### 1. Task 1
- Expected output: Summary of null values in key columns; Cleaned dataset with no missing values in
  CARRIER, CARRIER_NAME, MANUFACTURE_YEAR, NUMBER_OF_SEATS, CAPACITY_IN_POUNDS, and AIRLINE_ID.

### 2. Task 2
- Expected output: Value count of unique cleaned values for each category (manufactorer, model, aircraft_status, operating_status)
  
### 3. Task 3
- Expected output: Printed statement of number of rows after removing missing values (Number of rows after dropping missing values: 101275)

### 4. Task 4
- Expected output: 2 histograms for Number_of_seats and Capacity_in_pounds, each having their respective skewedness
  marked on top of the plot (without boxcox). Continue running the code to output 2 more histograms of these
  variables that include the boxcox transformation.

### 5. Task 5
- Expected output: This output should include 2 bar charts. The first bar chart should show the proportion of operating vs not operating
  aircrafts by size. The second bar chart should show the proportion of aircraft status by size. Both charts
  should also be accompanied by tables that print the numerical proporations for each segment of the chart (Y/N or A/B/L/O).
